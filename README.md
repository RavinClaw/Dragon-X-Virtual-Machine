[@] The Files have been uploaded and work as intended, some features do not work.
[#] The virtual machine is written in python and requires python to function, you will need to goto the file named "system.py" to install all of its imports
[~] The Virtual Machine has dirs, that you can use and store files in, currently they will not be saved.
[!] Next Update: Allowing the system.py file to save all of its dirs and access certian files only when in its dir.
